# MEAN Stack Training Application 

This is a repo for a training application for a Single Page MEAN Stack application. It is baseed off of the Mapping Application (https://github.com/michaelbowlin/mapping-app)
* Originally Based on the Joe Eames 'MultiVision' tutorial
* Later expanded into a working Mapping application
* During this training exercise I will deconstruct the app down to just a database with API. 
* Following the reverse engineering I will implement Applied Pathways Angular framework into the project strictly for training purposes.
